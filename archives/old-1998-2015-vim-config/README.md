# dotvim - Personal Vim Configuration

This is [my](https://github.com/jkuetemeier) ***personal*** vim configuration.
It is inspired by [dotvim](https://github.com/bling/dotvim) created by [Bailey
Ling](https://github.com/bling), particularly the configuration structure. I
also would like to thank [Steve Francia](http://spf13.com/) aka.
[spf13](https://github.com/spf13), [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) and
[Shougo](https://github.com/Shougo) for their work, plugins an configuration
examples.

## Installation

1.  clone this repository into your `~/.vim` directory
2.  `git clone --recursive git@github.com:jkuetemeier/dotvim.git .vim`
3.  `mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.backup`
4.  Choose a dotvimrc file `ln -s ~/.vim/dotvimrc ~/.vimrc` or create one:

```
let g:dotvim_settings = {}
let g:dotvim_settings.version = 1
source ~/.vim/vimrc
```
5.  On Fedora: `sudo yum install cmake gcc-c++ python-libs python-devel`
5.  startup vim and neobundle will detect and ask you install any missing
    plugins. You can also manually initiate this with `:NeoBundleInstall`.
    NOTE: *This step may take a long time for some plugins*
6.  done!


## Introduction

While it is very easy to install this and get up and running on a brand new
machine, i recommend that you do not install this unless you fully understand
everything that's going on inside. Scan it for tips and tricks, or fork and
customize it for *your* needs.

### Versioning

the `g:dotvim_settings.version` is a simple version number which is manually
edited.  it is used to detect whether significant breaking changes have been
introduced so that users of the distribution can be notified accordingly.

## Customization

*  since the distribution is just one file, customization is straightforward.
   any customizations can be added to the `g:dotvim_settings` variable, which
   will be used whilst sourcing the distribution's `vimrc` file.  here is an
   example:

```
" this is the bare minimum
let g:dotvim_settings = {}
let g:dotvim_settings.version = 2

" here are some basic customizations, please refer to the top of the vimrc file
" for all possible options
let g:dotvim_settings.default_indent = 3
let g:dotvim_settings.max_column = 80
let g:dotvim_settings.colorscheme = 'my_awesome_colorscheme'

" change the default directory where all miscellaneous persistent files go
let g:dotvim_settings.cache_dir = "/some/place/else"

" by default, language specific plugins are not loaded.  this can be changed
" with the following:
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups_exclude = ['ruby','python']

" if there are groups you want always loaded, you can use this:
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups_include = ['go']

" alternatively, you can set this variable to load exactly what you want
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups = ['core','web']

" if there is a particular plugin you don't like, you can define this variable
" to disable them entirely let
g:dotvim_settings.disabled_plugins=['vim-foo','vim-bar']

" finally, load the distribution
source ~/.vim/vimrc

" anything defined here are simply overrides
set wildignore+=\*/node_modules/\*
set guifont=Wingdings:h10
```

## Autocomplete

The default configuration uses [youcompleteme][ycm] + [ultisnips][us].
 [youcompleteme][ycm] needs to compile a Pyhton module. If there is no
 Python or compile environment, you can use.

1.  [neocomplete][nc] + [neosnippet][ns] if you have `lua` enabled.
2.  [neocomplcache][ncl] + [neosnippet][ns] if you only have vimscript
    available

This can be configured with `g:dotvim_settings.autocomplete_method`.

## Standard modifications

*  if you have either [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or
   [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed, they will be
   used for `grepprg`
*  all temporary files are stored in `~/.vim/.cache`, such as backup files and
   persistent undo

## Plugins

### [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)
*  this is an extremely powerful plugin that lets you build up lists from
   arbitrary sources
*  mappings
  *  `<space><space>` go to anything (files, buffers, MRU, bookmarks)
  *  `<space>y` select from previous yanks
  *  `<space>l` select line from current buffer
  *  `<space>b` select from current buffers
  *  `<space>o` select from outline of current file
  *  `<space>s` quick switch buffer

### [easygrep](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2438)
*  makes search/replacing in your project a lot easier without relying on
   `find` and `sed`
*  the loading time of this plugin is relatively heavy, so it is not loaded at
   startup.  to load it on-demand, use `<Leader>vo`, which opens the options
   window.
*  `<Leader>vv` find word under the cursor
*  `<Leader>vV` find whole word under the cursor
*  `<Leader>vr` perform global search replace of word under cursor, with
   confirmation

*  for supported most filetypes, `<tab>` will be mapped to automatically expand
   the line (you can use `<C-v><Tab>` to insert a tab character if needed)
*  for other features, default plugin mappings are available, which means
   `<C-y>` is the prefix, followed by a variety of options (see `:help
   zencoding`)

### [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
*  visualize the undo tree
*  `<F5>` to toggle
